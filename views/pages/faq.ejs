      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>What is JanSeva Tracker and how does it help me?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14"><line x1="7" y1="1" x2="7" y2="13"/><line x1="1" y1="7" x2="13" y2="7"/></svg></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-inner">JanSeva Tracker is a civic grievance platform that connects citizens directly with their municipal authority. You can report local problems — potholes, broken streetlights, water leaks, garbage overflow — and track their resolution in real time. No more endless phone calls or office visits; one submission puts your complaint on record with a unique ID and a live status trail.</div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>How long does it usually take for a complaint to be resolved?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14"><line x1="7" y1="1" x2="7" y2="13"/><line x1="1" y1="7" x2="13" y2="7"/></svg></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-inner">Resolution timelines depend on issue type and severity. Most complaints are acknowledged within 48 hours. Minor issues like a broken streetlight or uncollected garbage are typically resolved within 5–7 days. Larger infrastructure issues such as road damage or sewage repair have a 14–21 day SLA. You'll get notified at every stage — Received, Acknowledged, In Progress, and Resolved.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>What types of civic issues can I report?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14"><line x1="7" y1="1" x2="7" y2="13"/><line x1="1" y1="7" x2="13" y2="7"/></svg></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-inner">You can report potholes and road damage, broken or missing streetlights, water supply disruptions, open drainage and sewage overflow, uncollected garbage, stray animal hazards, illegal construction or encroachments on public land, and damaged public property like benches or bus shelters. If it affects your neighbourhood's safety, hygiene, or mobility — report it.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>Can I attach photos or videos when filing a complaint?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14"><line x1="7" y1="1" x2="7" y2="13"/><line x1="1" y1="7" x2="13" y2="7"/></svg></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-inner">Yes — and we strongly recommend it. Visual evidence significantly speeds up complaint verification and reduces back-and-forth with the department. You can attach up to 5 photos per complaint. If your photo is geotagged, the location field is filled in automatically, making submission even faster.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>What if my complaint is marked "Resolved" but the problem still exists?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14"><line x1="7" y1="1" x2="7" y2="13"/><line x1="1" y1="7" x2="13" y2="7"/></svg></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-inner">You have a 5-day window to reopen a complaint using the "Not Fixed" option in My Complaints. Upload a fresh photo and add a brief note describing what's still wrong. Reopened complaints are automatically escalated one level higher in the department hierarchy, and a stricter SLA is applied. Repeated false closures are flagged to the municipal supervisor.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>Is my personal information safe and visible to others?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14"><line x1="7" y1="1" x2="7" y2="13"/><line x1="1" y1="7" x2="13" y2="7"/></svg></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-inner">Your privacy is protected. Only the complaint category and general location are shown on the public issue map — never your name, phone number, or address. That information is visible only to the municipal officer handling your case, who is bound by government data protection regulations. We do not sell or share your data with any third party.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>Can I see other complaints filed in my neighbourhood?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14"><line x1="7" y1="1" x2="7" y2="13"/><line x1="1" y1="7" x2="13" y2="7"/></svg></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-inner">Yes. The public Issue Map on the homepage shows all active and recently resolved complaints near you, with personal details hidden. If you spot an issue someone else already reported, hit "Me Too" to upvote it. Complaints with more upvotes are flagged for priority review, so your support genuinely speeds up resolution for the whole community.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>Do I need to visit any government office to file or follow up on a complaint?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14"><line x1="7" y1="1" x2="7" y2="13"/><line x1="1" y1="7" x2="13" y2="7"/></svg></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-inner">No — that's exactly the problem JanSeva Tracker solves. Everything is done online. You file the complaint, receive updates, reopen if needed, and view the outcome entirely through the platform or via SMS notifications. If escalation is ever needed, our support team handles the communication with the department on your behalf.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>Can I report an issue on behalf of someone else or my entire street?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14"><line x1="7" y1="1" x2="7" y2="13"/><line x1="1" y1="7" x2="13" y2="7"/></svg></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-inner">Absolutely. You can file a complaint for any location — you don't have to be personally affected. For widespread issues like a flooded street or a colony without power, share the complaint link with your neighbours so they can upvote it. Community-backed complaints with multiple upvotes are treated as high-priority by the municipal department.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>Is JanSeva Tracker affiliated with the government?</span>
        <div class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14"><line x1="7" y1="1" x2="7" y2="13"/><line x1="1" y1="7" x2="13" y2="7"/></svg></div>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-inner">JanSeva Tracker works in partnership with municipal corporations under smart-city and e-governance frameworks — but it is independently operated to ensure neutrality and accountability. Complaints submitted here are officially routed into the municipal grievance system, so they carry the same weight as complaints filed directly, with the added benefit of transparent tracking.</div>
